This policy outlines our return and refund procedures to ensure a seamless and supportive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Damaged or Defective Products: If you receive a product that is damaged, defective, or faulty, please contact our support team within 3 days of delivery to report the issue. Provide your order number, photos of the product, and a brief description of the issue. We will guide you through the return or refund process promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Eligibility for Refunds: To be eligible for a refund, the product must be unused, unopened, and in its original packaging. Any product that has been altered or used will not be eligible for a refund. We reserve the right to inspect the returned product before processing any refund. Shipping charges are non-refundable, unless the return is due to our error.
        </p>

            3. Return Process: To initiate a return, follow these steps:
            - Contact our support team for a Return Authorization (RA) number.
            - Pack the product in its original packaging to avoid damage.
            - Include the receipt or proof of purchase with your return.
            - Ship the item to the address provided by our customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Refund Processing Time: Once we receive the returned item, it will be inspected. If eligible, your refund will be processed within 7-10 business days. The refund will be issued to your original payment method. Please note, credit card refund processing times may vary depending on your bank’s policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Exceptions: Some items are non-returnable and non-refundable, including perishable goods, customized products, and items marked as "final sale." Please review the product description before purchasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Exchange Policy: If you want to exchange an item for another, please contact our support team. Exchanges are subject to the same eligibility criteria as returns. Any price differences between the exchanged items must be settled before the exchange is processed.
