        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>At AI-Powered Mental Health Companion, we understand that situations may change, and you may need to cancel your orders. We have established this cancellation policy to ensure that our customers have a smooth experience when making changes to their orders.</p>

        <div class="pastel-card">
            <h3>1. Eligibility for Cancellation</h3>
            <p>Orders can be canceled at any time before they are dispatched. Once your order has been shipped, cancellation is no longer possible, and the standard return policy applies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>2. Refund Process</h3>
            <p>If your cancellation request is processed, the refund will be initiated within 24-48 hours after confirmation. The refund will be credited back to your original payment method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>3. How to Cancel</h3>
            <p>To cancel your order, please contact our customer support team via email at support@mentalhealthcompanion.com or call +1-800-123-4567. Ensure you provide your order number and the reason for cancellation.</p>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>4. Late Cancellations</h3>
            <p>If you attempt to cancel your order after it has been dispatched, we will not be able to process the cancellation. However, you can initiate a return once the product arrives at your address, following the standard return process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this cancellation policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about the terms of cancellation.</p>
